Currently, I am a senior full-stack developer at DanskeBank.

Fun fact: I do own only a 25 feet boat and usually sail in a lake.",Meetups%204de46201709244e2a0c58c130a433730/vilius-rokus.jpg,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vroskus/,Vilius Roškus,"Setting up test tools and understanding what has to be tested sometimes is quite an issue that does not encourage implementing tests on one's application, especially for the junior devs. Yet, maintaining and continuously encouraging the team not to forget the tests is sometimes a headache for senior devs.

Most importantly, I'll show you how to create an automated test requirement watchdog that would not allow application further evolution by you or your team without taking care of the tests.",Reverse Enforced Test Driven Development: Making e2e Tests Easy,"Saltoniškių g. 7b, Vilnius",DanskeBank - DC Valley,https://www.meetup.com/vilnius-js/events/288855032/,https://vilniusjs.lt/2022/10/02/meetup-october.html
